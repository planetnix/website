Learn how Anthropic took production startup times from minutes to sub-second with a multi-level, replicated cache hierarchy. We’ll deep dive into nix-sidecar: our custom tool to escape Docker, replacing slow image pulls with highly-parallel native Nix fetches, cached on every node.

In this talk, I&#x27;ll give an overview on how remote Nix builds work in practice, and talk about their possibilities and limitations. I&#x27;ll also lift the lid on Nix and show how the remote builder protocol works.

Finally I&#x27;ll mention some improvements I&#x27;d like to see in Nix, based on my experience on implementing the nixbuild.net service.</p>

What makes users choose Nix? How long does it take for them to get their colleagues onboard? What do they learn along the way?

In this quick talk, Ross from Flox will go over a few of the most amazing stories from Nix in the Wild (rawr!)...and let you know how we can help you tell yours.</p>

          <p class="schedule-description">Evaluating packages with big dependency trees with nix is time consuming.
Currently, while there is a local eval cache, evaluation costs are sum up locally but also globally as eval caches are generally not shared across machine or user boundaries.
In other places such as searching packages, evaluation is impossible, prohibitively expensive, or just annoying.
In this talk I want to introduce different approaches to avoid evaluations, how they are motivated and what their limits are.</p>

          <p class="schedule-description">At DEF CON 32, a few friends pushed binary caching on NixOS to its limits. Thanks to a generous hardware donation by Protectli, we managed to get a mesh network of binary cache servers running in our backpacks, with Nebula mesh VPN and 802.11s mesh WiFi running between them using TPMs for key exchange.

We see a future where trustworthy software can be built and fetched from nearly anywhere, and every device can be a node in a swarm of Nix binary caches. Follow along as we build a true edge CDN!</p>

Instead of simply suggesting they get a Chromebook, what if we could create a similar experience with NixOS? My Nixbook project delivers automatic updates, easy Flatpak app installs, and sane defaults for everyday users.

In this talk, I’ll share how I built it and made it work flawlessly.

          <p class="schedule-description">Flakes are a way to share Nix artifacts in a reproducible, composable and discoverable way. A major limitation of flakes right now is that they are not *configurable*: there is no easy way to pass arguments to a flake from the command line. In this talk, I describe an extension of flake schemas that make flakes configurable in a way that preserves discoverability, hermetic evaluation and evaluation caching. This addresses a major blocker in the adoption of flakes.

Sandstone is a new tool to plan Haskell builds using Nix that achieves full incrementality without affecting eval times at all. It does this by using the new experimental &quot;dynamic derivations&quot; to create fine-grained build steps without involving the Nix language *at all*. 

We hope that Sandstone will kick of a new era of language-specific tooling using Nix!</p>
