## About the Event

Calling all Earthlings. Attention. Calling all planetary life units. Please assemble.

The Earth chapter of Planet Nix is assembling, and we need you! This is your chance to represent your beautifully unpredictable planet and dive into the power of [Nix](https://nixos.org/).

Join Nixers of all ranks - whether you're a cadet or a commodore - and hack, learn, and unlock new Nix abilities. Participate in workshops designed to push your skills to new heights. Then, take what you've learned back to your home base, and teach others to build and ship software with consistency across space and time.

Our meeting spot is located in the city of Pasadena in your Earth zone of Los Angeles. It will co-locate with the SCALE conference, which our instruments have identified as the largest spontaneous concentration of Nix packages at rest.

We hope to see you at Planet Nix. We will provide human snacks, coffee, and a galaxy of knowledge. And maybe a few surprises. Come for the workshops, stay for the fun.

End of transmission.

## **FAQ**

### Do I need to prepare anything?

As you prepare for the event we'd like to encourage all attendees to download any important repositories to their local machines and prepare their API-Keys beforehand as we will get rate limited by some organizations.

The Nix manual shows how to configure nix to use with [access-tokens](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.24/command-ref/conf-file.html#conf-access-tokens).

For GitHub for example we recommend a [fine-grained token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new) with no extra account permissions, as it will be only used for authentication purposes.

### I am interested in helping? What can I do?

We are actively looking for volunteers for before, during and after the event. If you are interested, please find one of the organizers.

### Will there be video recording?

Yes, you can view the livestream on the [SCaLE Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@socallinuxexpo).

### This website is broken! Can I fix it?

Yes! The website source is at: [https://github.com/planetnix/website](https://github.com/planetnix/website)

### What is a Unconf?

An Unconference is all about you taking the lead. No predetermined schedules or set topics. Have a burning question or exciting idea about Nix? Grab a group, snag a table, and dive into the conversation. This is your time to connect with like-minded individuals and discuss whatever you're passionate about.
