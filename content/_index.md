## About

Calling all Earthlings. Attention. Calling all planetary life units. Please assemble. 

The Earth chapter of Planet Nix is assembling, and we need you! This is your chance to represent your beautifully unpredictable planet and dive into the power of [Nix](https://nixos.org/).

Join Nixers of all ranks - whether you're a cadet or a commodore - and hack, learn, and unlock new Nix abilities. Participate in workshops designed to push your skills to new heights. Then, take what you've learned back to your home base, and teach others to build and ship software with consistency across space and time.

Our meeting spot is located in the city of Pasadena in your Earth zone of Los Angeles. It will co-locate with the SCALE conference, which our instruments have identified as the largest spontaneous concentration of Nix packages at rest.

We hope to see you at Planet Nix. We will provide human snacks, coffee, and a galaxy of knowledge. And maybe a few surprises. Come for the workshops, stay for the fun.

End of transmission.

## **Call for Proposals (CFP)**

We are excited to invite speakers, workshop leaders, and panelists to [submit proposals](https://sessionize.com/planet-nix-2025/) for **Planet Nix**! We're looking for engaging talks and workshops related to:

- Nix package management and ecosystem
- NixOS configuration management
- Development workflows with Nix
- Contributing to Nix projects
- Scaling Nix in production environments
- Case studies and success stories
- New tools and integrations

We are hoping to create an event with something for those of all skill levels. You don't have to be a wizard to teach at Planet Nix, but you also don't have to be a newbie to learn! Nix doesn't have to be your full-time job to present at Planet Nix, but it also doesn't have to *not* be your job.

There will be two tracks across two days. The schedule will provide for a mix of talks and workshops, and we encourage you to help attendees get hands-on experience with Nix.

If you're passionate about Nix, this is your opportunity to share your expertise and ideas with a vibrant community.

### **Submission Deadline:** **January 6, 2025**

### **How to Submit:**

Please submit your proposal by filling out the [submission form](https://sessionize.com/planet-nix-2025/) with the following details:

- Title of your talk or workshop
- Abstract (200-300 words)
- Speaker bio
- Any additional requirements (e.g., technical setup)
