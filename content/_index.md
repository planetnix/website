## About the Event

Calling all Earthlings. Attention. Calling all planetary life units. Please assemble. 

The Earth chapter of Planet Nix is assembling, and we need you! This is your chance to represent your beautifully unpredictable planet and dive into the power of [Nix](https://nixos.org/).

Join Nixers of all ranks - whether you're a cadet or a commodore - and hack, learn, and unlock new Nix abilities. Participate in workshops designed to push your skills to new heights. Then, take what you've learned back to your home base, and teach others to build and ship software with consistency across space and time.

Our meeting spot is located in the city of Pasadena in your Earth zone of Los Angeles. It will co-locate with the SCALE conference, which our instruments have identified as the largest spontaneous concentration of Nix packages at rest.

We hope to see you at Planet Nix. We will provide human snacks, coffee, and a galaxy of knowledge. And maybe a few surprises. Come for the workshops, stay for the fun.

End of transmission.
